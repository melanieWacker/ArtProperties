# ArtProperties
This space will host documentation, models and sample RDF data for linked data representations of Columbia Universityâ€™s art object metadata. Columbia's art collection is overseen by Art Properties at the Avery Architectural &amp; Fine Arts Library. The data was mapped to the [ARM ontology](https://github.com/LD4P/arm), which has been developed through the work of the ArtFrame and Rare Materials Ontology BIBFRAME extensions, both sub-projects of [Linked Data for Production (LD4P)](http://LD4P.org).
